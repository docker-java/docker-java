### Code Design
  * Model is based on Objects and not primitives that allows nullify requests and have null values for data
  that wasn't provided by docker daemon.
  * For null safeness findbugs annotations are used.
  ** Every method that may return `null` (and we are unsure in any fields as docker daemon may change something)
     should be annotated with `@CheckForNull` return qualifier from `javax.annotation` package.
  ** Methods that can't return `null` must be annotated with `@Nonnull`.
  ** The same for Arguments.
  ** `@Nullable` must be used only for changing inherited (other typed) qualifier.
  * Setters in builder style must be prefixed with `withXX`.
  * All classes should provide `toString()` `equals()` and `hashCode()` defined methods.
  * Javadocs
  ** Provide full information on field:
  *** For models define API version with `@since {@link RemoteApiVersion#VERSION_1_X}`.
  ** getters/setters should refernce to field `@see #$field`.

### Coding style
  * TBD, some initial styling already enforced with checkstyle.
  IDEA/checkstyle file analogues will be provided soon.

### Testing
  * Unit tests for serder (serialization-deserialization).
  * Integration tests for commands.
  * If model object has builders, then fill it with data and compare by `equals()` with expected response
  from docker daemon. If failed, then some fields mappings are wrong.
